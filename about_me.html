        <p>
            Shuyi Cen is currently enrolled as a fourth-year student at Drexel University, and she specializes in Interior Design and Interactive Digital Media. She was born and raised in Guangdong, China, and she moved to Maryland, the USA with her family in 2013.

            Before Shuyi decided to join Drexel University, she had already gotten an Associated Degree in Maryland and focused on Fine Art. Throughout her college life, she didnâ€™t join a lot of outside activities. She worked as a language volunteer at school to helped translated Chinese and English.

            She designed many projects at school. According to Shuyi, one of her favorite design projects is a preschool project for ages between 1 to 6. She claims that preschool is not just a commercial building, it is also residential. Children are spending half-day to stay at school, and she wants to make sure the space that she designs makes people feel welcome and as warm as home.
