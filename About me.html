<h2>Shuyi Cen</h2>
<h3>Interior Design</h3>
<p>

    Before Shuyi decided to join Drexel University, she had already gotten an Associated Degree in Maryland and focused on Fine Art. Throughout her college life, she didnâ€™t join a lot of outside activities. She worked as a language volunteer at school to helped translated Chinese and English.

    She designed many projects at school. According to Shuyi, one of her favorite design projects is a preschool project for ages between 1 to 6. She claims that preschool is not just a commercial building, it is also residential. Children are spending half-day to stay at school, and she wants to make sure the space that she designs makes people feel welcome and as warm as home.
